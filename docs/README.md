# OctoAcme Project Management — Quick Overview

OctoAcme runs projects with a clear, staged lifecycle that moves from initiation through planning, execution, release, and retrospective. Initiation uses a lightweight Project One-pager (problem, goal, success metrics, stakeholders) and a decision gate that confirms success metrics, stakeholder alignment, and team availability before moving to planning. Planning breaks approved initiatives into a prioritized backlog with acceptance criteria, estimates, a Definition of Done, a release plan and milestone map, and a documented risk register for dependencies and mitigations.

Day-to-day execution follows a disciplined workflow driven by a project board (Backlog → Ready → In Progress → In Review → QA → Done) and a Pull Request process that encourages small PRs, links to issues and acceptance criteria, runs automated CI checks, and requires approvals before merging. Team rhythm includes short daily standups for blockers and coordination, weekly delivery syncs to surface progress and risks, and demos at the end of sprints or milestones. Communication templates and cadences (weekly PM+PdM syncs, monthly stakeholder updates, and a single source-of-truth project README or release document) make status and asks predictable.

Roles and responsibilities are explicit: Product Managers (PdM) own outcomes, success metrics and backlog prioritization; Project Managers (PM) coordinate schedules, risk, and stakeholder communication; Developers implement and test features; QA validates quality and acceptance criteria; stakeholders provide approvals and input. These personas are used consistently across docs to set expectations for handoffs, ownership, and typical communications (standups, PR reviews, and stakeholder briefings).

Quality and risk controls are embedded across the lifecycle: CI-run unit, integration, and security scans; end-to-end smoke tests for critical flows; manual QA where needed; and pre-release checklists (release notes, rollback plans, staging smoke tests). The release playbook specifies release types, rollback and incident steps, and post-incident retrospectives. Risk management is operationalized via a simple risk register (impact, likelihood, owner, mitigation, status) and an escalation path from team-level triage up to sponsor and security on-call for critical incidents.
